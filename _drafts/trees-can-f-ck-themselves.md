**After a series of test and all due considerations, Drax shareholders have voted unanimously that trees can "f*ck themselves".**

This was entirely expected, as we have been unrelentingly feeding the world with lies about how burning trees is actually wonderful. We are plesently surprised in how quickly it go the this stage, but are grateful non the less.

We understand there may be some concerns that rise from this. Hopefully this will address them.

## Don't we need trees?

No. Trees are actually bad for your health, instead we recommend a quick death and freezing your body in a cryogenic chamber until the world has burned itself to death.
