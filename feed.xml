&lt;p&gt;Instead we should aim for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Zero Tree Economy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Super colonialism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If we just colonise Mars then eat the rocks then we should be okay&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was entirely expected, as we have been unrelentingly feeding the world with lies about how burning trees is actually wonderful. We are plesently surprised in how quickly it go the this stage, but are grateful non the less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand there may be some concerns that rise from this. Hopefully this will address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-we-need-trees&quot;&gt;Don‚Äôt we need trees?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Trees are actually bad for your health, instead we recommend a quick death and freezing your body in a cryogenic chamber until the world has burned itself to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-exactly-does-a-tree-fck-itself&quot;&gt;How, exactly, does a tree f*ck itself?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is for us to know and you to dream of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-trees-in-my-local-park&quot;&gt;What about the trees in my local park?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, those too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we hope that all worries have been cleared up.
